                I created this place to show case my abilites with C#, Javascript and Entity Framework.
                This is a code first Entity Framework approach documenting my match history in the popular video game DotA 2

        <!--<p>This site is based off a code first approach to populate a database with my personal DotA history. Match data is pulled through
        valve's API and comes in two parts, a general match response with high level details about the match and a match details
        call that includes specific information on a given match for each player. In this case a match has a list of connected match details
        which includes a player and their items linked by a cross table of player-items.</p>
        <!--insert image of api calls-->
        <!--<p>
            The API calls are located in Entities project under SteamAPI. I make use of the Rest Sharp package to simpilfy the process. Once the data
            is stored in an API model I then have to format it into a useable data structure. This is all done in the SeedDatabase class which is
            called when you perform an update-database command.
        </p>-->
        <p>The data is then loading in the controller and passed to the views. I also make use of D3.js which is a javascript library useful 
        for displaying data visually. </p>
